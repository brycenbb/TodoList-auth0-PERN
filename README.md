# TodoList-auth0-PERN
To-do list build using React functional components that incorporates the PERN stack.

This project was done as a part of the first React hackathon done in Week 7 of School of Code over the course of about 4 hours. Having quickly completed my minimal viable product, I pushed myself to add Express, Postgres, and Node components to the project as well as independently learning and including Auth0 for user authentication. This respository shows the working proof of concept rather than a fully deployed app. 

The key reason to include user authenitcation was to allow for persistent custom To-do lists - which is done by querying the database.
Key features missing include the ability to store new list items or permanently delete old items as well as hiding the log out/in button coressponding to the current user status (logged in or logged out) - these may be added at a later date
